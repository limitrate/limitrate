### 1.4 Simplify C3: Pre-Flight Validation ✅ ALREADY DONE

**Approach:** Keep validation utilities, remove auto-enforcement

**Files to Keep (as utilities):**
- `packages/core/src/validation/` - Entire directory ✓

**Verification:**
- [x] No auto-validation in `packages/express/src/middleware.ts` - validation is already manual-only

**Status:** ✅ Already in correct state - no changes needed

---

### 1.5 Simplify C4: Streaming Response Tracking ✅ ALREADY DONE

**Approach:** Keep StreamingTracker utility, remove auto-interception

- `packages/core/src/streaming/tracker.ts` ✓
- `packages/core/src/streaming/index.ts` ✓

**Verification:**
- [x] No stream interception in `packages/express/src/middleware.ts` - streaming is already manual-only
- [x] No `trackStreaming` config in LimitRateOptions - utilities are standalone
- [x] Exports already marked as utilities in index.ts

**Status:** ✅ Already in correct state - no changes needed

---

### 1.6 Make B2: Endpoint Discovery Opt-In ✅ COMPLETED

**Approach:** Disable by default, require explicit opt-in

**Files to Modify:**
- [x] `packages/express/src/types.ts` - Change trackEndpoints default to false

- [ ] Update documentation (will be done in Phase 3)

**Status:** ✅ Complete (2025-11-08)

---

## Phase 2: Test Suite Cleanup

### 2.1 Delete Removed Feature Tests ✅ COMPLETED

**Tests to Delete:**
- [x] `test-d4-simple.cjs` - Already deleted in Phase 1
- [x] `test-d4-penalty-reward.cjs` - Already deleted in Phase 1
- [x] `test-d5-ipv6-subnet.cjs` - Already deleted in Phase 1
- [x] `test-d6-job-scheduler.cjs` - Already deleted in Phase 1

**Status:** ✅ Complete (2025-11-08)

---

### 2.2 Update Test Runner ✅ NO CHANGES NEEDED

**Files to Modify:**

- [x] Test runner doesn't list D4/D5/D6 tests explicitly - no changes needed
- [ ] Verify all remaining tests pass (will be done in Phase 4)

**Status:** ✅ No changes needed - test runner uses file discovery

---

### 2.3 Update Existing Tests ✅ COMPLETED

**Tests to Update:**
- [x] `test-b2-auto-discovery.js` - Already has explicit `trackEndpoints: true`, updated comment
